Units for the quarterly LD are biomass at length from the fishery

Weight length model parameters are as follows

Males, a=0.00038, b-3.17
Females, a=0.00091, b=2.895

Model is weight=(length^b)*a

Landings are in tonnes, effort in arbitrary units.
Lencat is length of vessel (uner 10m and over 10m).

season = quarter
1= Winter
2=Spring
